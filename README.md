An application for tracking your personal finances.

To get the price of metals I use a service from goldapi.io and it requires a
token (free for 100 requests per month). The token is stored in a file named
"goldapi.io.txt" stored in the same directory as the program
is run from or your home directory if you installed the application.

You can import Bank of America transactions via Import BoA.

Via Tx 2nd you can get the price of metals, mutual funds, stocks, Bitcoin,
Ethereum, and Gnosis. Tx 2nd becomes active when you select one of these
currencies. Tx is the currency Tx 2nd is traded in. When you select "Get Price"
Tx is populated with the quantity of Tx 2nd you hold times the current price
(sometimes a day old price).

Via Monthly Tx it supports making predictions into the future for what will
happen to your finances. It also automatically submits these transactions at
the beginning of each month.

On Tx and 2nd Tx you can limit transactions displayed by month.

Because there are many metals and stocks to choose from and many possible
fiat currencies, you select which ones you want in your config file. An
example of a config is shown in demo-ledger.ron. All the allowed fiat
currencies are shown.

I may allow for cypto currencies in the same way I do stocks and metals, but I
haven't figured out the best way to support it yet.
